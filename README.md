- <span style="font-size: 20px">**Add at least 3 Project features :**</span>

##  Answers
- This project is created by React + vite.
   The combination of React and Vite provides a modern, efficient, and flexible development environment with a great developer experience.
- At the home page a search button had added .If user try to find donation card with it's category name they can do it easily.
- Navbar is fully responsible for all devices.If user's device width is less than 768px, the top-right menus will be disappear and a icon will be shown. And if user will do a click  on the icon the menu buttons will be shown vertically. 
- I have used useLocation hook; for an example, the value of the location object changes (user will see it at the top of browser where title was shown) whenever the user navigates to a new URL.

- At the statistics route use will get an experience with live pi chart view ,which is actually works foe total data vs donated data.
